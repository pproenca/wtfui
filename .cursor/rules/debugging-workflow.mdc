# Debugging Workflow

Use this workflow to systematically fix bugs without guessing.

## Reference

Full protocol: `@.cursor/skills/systematic-debugging.md`

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Investigation (Mandatory)

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Errors**: Don't guess. Read the stack trace completely.
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes
   - They often contain the exact solution

2. **Reproduce**: Create a reproduction case
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?

3. **Check Recent Changes**:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~5
   git log --oneline -10
   ```
   What changed that could cause this?

4. **Trace Data Flow** (for multi-component systems):
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - Add diagnostic logging at component boundaries
   - Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks

### Phase 2: Diagnosis

1. **Form Hypothesis**: State "I think X is causing Y because Z"
   - Be specific, not vague
   - Write it down

2. **Test Minimally**:
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify**: Did it work?
   - Yes → Phase 3
   - No → Form NEW hypothesis, don't add more fixes on top

### Phase 3: Fix

1. **TDD**: Write a failing test first
   - See `@.cursor/skills/test-driven-development.md`
   - Test proves the bug exists

2. **Implement**: Fix the root cause (not the symptom)
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements

3. **Verify**: Run the test
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Original symptom resolved?

### Phase 4: If 3+ Fixes Failed

**STOP and question the architecture.**

Pattern indicating architectural problem:
- Each fix reveals new problem in different place
- Fixes require "massive refactoring"
- Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

**Discuss with user before attempting more fixes.**

This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## Critical Rules

- **No Blind Fixes**: Never propose a fix without evidence
- **No Shotgun Debugging**: Change one thing at a time
- **Verify**: Run tests after every change
- **Evidence First**: See `@.cursor/skills/verification-before-completion.md`

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Diagnosis** | Form hypothesis, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **3. Fix** | TDD cycle, fix root cause | Bug resolved, tests pass |
