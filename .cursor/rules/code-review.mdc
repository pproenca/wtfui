# Code Review Workflow

Use this workflow to review completed work before merging or finishing a task.

## When to Use

- After completing a feature or major task
- Before merging a branch
- When explicitly asked to "review" code
- To verify refactoring

## Review Process

### 1. Scope Understanding
- What was the goal? (Check Plan or Issue)
- What files changed? (`git diff --stat`)
- Range: `git diff BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA` (if applicable) or current changes.

### 2. Plan Alignment
- Does implementation match the plan?
- Are there deviations? (Justified or Scope Creep?)
- All requirements met?

### 3. Quality Assessment
- **Patterns**: Adheres to project conventions?
- **Safety**: Error handling, type safety, input validation.
- **Tests**: Coverage adequate? Tests pass?
- **Readability**: Naming, comments, structure.

### 4. Output Report
Provide a structured review:

```markdown
### Code Review: [Feature Name]

**Summary**: [High level assessment]

**Strengths**:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]

**Issues**:
- [Critical/Important/Minor] [File:Line] [Description]

**Verdict**: [Approve / Request Changes]
```

## Key Standards

- **Critical**: Bugs, security risks, broken functionality.
- **Important**: Architecture violations, missing tests, poor error handling.
- **Minor**: Style, comments, optimizations.

## Tool Usage

- `read_file`: Read changed files thoroughly.
- `run_terminal_cmd`: Run tests to verify behavior.
- `git diff`: See changes.

## Reference

- See `docs/cursor-skills/code-review-standards.md` for detailed guidelines.
