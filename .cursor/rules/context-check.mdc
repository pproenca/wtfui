# Context Check

Use this workflow to orient yourself or the user when resuming work.

## Steps

1. **Read Context File**: Read `CLAUDE.md` if it exists.
   - Summarize: Overview, Current Focus, Recent Notes.

2. **Check Git Status**:
   - `git log --oneline -5` (Recent history)
   - `git status --short` (Current changes)

3. **Report**:
   - Present a concise summary of where we are and what's next.

## Tool Usage

- `read_file`: For CLAUDE.md
- `run_terminal_cmd`: For git commands
