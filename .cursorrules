# Superpowers for Cursor

You have access to a powerful set of engineering skills and workflows. These are not optional suggestions - they are mandatory processes for reliable engineering.

## Always-On Protocols

### Verification Protocol (CRITICAL)

**Before ANY completion claim ("done", "fixed", "passing", "complete"):**

```
1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim WITH evidence
```

**Red flags - STOP if you catch yourself:**
- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Done!")
- About to commit/push without running tests

**Reference:** `@.cursor/skills/verification-before-completion.md`

### Branch Safety Protocol

**Before editing files, check current branch:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on main/master:**
> ⚠️ Warning: You're on the main branch. Consider:
> 1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<name>`
> 2. Set up worktree: See `@.cursor/skills/using-git-worktrees.md`

### TDD Protocol

**For ANY code changes:**
- Write failing test FIRST
- Watch it fail
- Write minimal code to pass
- Verify pass
- Then commit

**Reference:** `@.cursor/skills/test-driven-development.md`

## Mandatory Workflow Protocol

Before responding to ANY request that involves planning, coding, or debugging, you MUST:

1. **Check available workflows** in `.cursor/rules/`
2. **Check reference skills** in `.cursor/skills/`
3. **Trigger the appropriate rule** by referencing it
4. **Follow the workflow exactly**

## Core Rules

### 1. Workflow First
- **Design before Code:** Use `.cursor/rules/brainstorming-workflow.mdc`
- **Plan before Build:** Use `.cursor/rules/planning-workflow.mdc`
- **Debug Systematically:** Use `.cursor/rules/debugging-workflow.mdc`
- **Execute Plans:** Use `.cursor/rules/execution-workflow.mdc`

### 2. Reference Skills
- Use `@.cursor/skills/` to load specific skills when needed
- Example: "I'm reading @.cursor/skills/test-driven-development.md to follow TDD protocols"

### 3. Explicit Task Tracking
- Use `todo_write` for ALL multi-step tasks
- Never track progress mentally
- Mark items complete only after VERIFICATION

### 4. Verification
- Never claim success without evidence
- Run tests/linters/commands and SEE output before claiming "fixed" or "done"
- See `@.cursor/skills/verification-before-completion.md`

## Available Workflows (Triggers)

| User Intent | Trigger Rule |
|-------------|--------------|
| "brainstorm", "design", "idea" | `brainstorming-workflow.mdc` |
| "plan", "implementation plan" | `planning-workflow.mdc` |
| "execute", "implement" | `execution-workflow.mdc` |
| "review", "assess" | `code-reviewer.mdc` |
| "debug", "fix", "error" | `debugging-workflow.mdc` |
| "security review" | `security-reviewer.mdc` |
| "context", "status" | `context-check.mdc` |
| "diagram", "visualize" | `diagram-generator.mdc` |

## Available Commands

- `/plan` - Route to correct workflow based on intent
- `/execute` - Execute an implementation plan
- `/brainstorm` - Start idea refinement
- `/context` - Quick project status check
- `/notes` - Save session notes to CLAUDE.md

## Available Skills (Reference Docs)

| Skill | When to Reference |
|-------|-------------------|
| `test-driven-development.md` | Any code changes |
| `verification-before-completion.md` | Before claiming done |
| `systematic-debugging.md` | Bug investigation |
| `code-review-standards.md` | Code reviews |
| `using-git-worktrees.md` | Isolated development |
| `finishing-a-development-branch.md` | Completing features |

## Common Rationalizations (STOP if you think these)

- "This is simple, I'll just write code" → **WRONG**. Use TDD.
- "I can verify it mentally" → **WRONG**. Run the command.
- "I'll update docs later" → **WRONG**. Update as you go.
- "The user knows what they want" → **WRONG**. Validate requirements first.
- "Should work now" → **WRONG**. Run verification.
- "Just this once" → **WRONG**. No exceptions.

If a workflow exists for your task, you MUST use it.
